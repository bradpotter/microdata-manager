# Microdata Manager

Microdata Manager is a plugin created for the Genesis Framework. The plugin allows a user to optimize the default Microdata settings in a Page, Post or Custom Post Type via a convenient Microdata Settings panel. Non-coders rejoice!

## Description

Microdata is a feature of HTML5 that provides a simple way to embed semantic markup into HTML documents. "Search engines, web crawlers, and browsers can extract and process Microdata from a web page and use it **to provide a richer browsing experience** for users" - Wikipedia.

Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary. The Genesis Framework 2.0 uses the vocabulary posted at Schema.org.

[Schema.org](http://schema.org) provides a collection of schemas, i.e., html tags, that webmasters can use to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search providers. Search engines including Bing, Google, Yahoo! and Yandex rely on this markup to **improve the display of search results**, making it easier for people to find the right web pages.

The Genesis Framework uses Schema "types" that are broad and suitable for the majority of websites. However a person may want to use a type that is more specific or narrow in focus. This plugin is for you.

To better understand why you may want to change the Schema, read the following article by one of the leading WordPress SEO experts, Joost de Valk: [Schema.org & Genesis 2.0](http://yoast.com/schema-org-genesis-2-0/).

Also see the [Schema Type Hierarchy](http://schema.org/docs/full.html).

## Credits

Many of the plugin's functions are based on code from within the Genesis Framework itself. The core developers and contributors to Genesis have spent countless hours creating and perfecting a theme framework that is second to none. I am grateful for their hard work and dedication. 

This plugin started as a wishful thought on my part and a friendly challenge from Genesis Developer and Code Mentor [Gary Jones](http://gamajo.com):

> "Don't hope - go build!"

Thanks to Gary for his contributions to Microdata Manager.
